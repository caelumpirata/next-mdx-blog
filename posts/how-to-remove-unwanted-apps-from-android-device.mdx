Follow these steps to remove the unwanted apps from you Android Device easily.

## Things you will need

1. Computer
2. Usb Cable
3. [SDK Platform Tools](https://developer.android.com/tools/releases/platform-tools)

## 1. Connect your Android Device with ADB

Open Settings in your Android Device.
Navigate to About Phone.
Tap Build Number 7-8 times.

Accept the Allow USB Debugging popup in you android device.

Next,

```
adb shell
```

this command will list the packages installed inside your device

```
pm list packages
```

2. Uninstalling the Apps
   To uninstall the apps, we will need the exact package name of the app.
   `App info` shows the package name
   ![find package name in app info](/images/app_info.webp)
   or, you can download this to get the package name

[App Inspector - Apps on Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ubqsoft.sec01&hl=en_US)

run this command to delete the app

```
pm uninstall -k --user 0 NameOfPackage
```

in my case it is `org.lineage0s.audiofx`
