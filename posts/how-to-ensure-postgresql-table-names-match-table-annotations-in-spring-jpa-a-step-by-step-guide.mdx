Are you struggling to create PostgreSQL tables with names that match exactly what you specify in your Spring JPA @Table annotations, especially when dealing with uppercase letters? Look no further! In this tutorial, we'll walk through a simple yet effective approach to ensure that your table names align perfectly with your annotations.

## Background:

When using Spring JPA with PostgreSQL, you might encounter a situation where the table names generated by Hibernate don't match what you specify in your entity classes. This discrepancy can be particularly troublesome when your desired table name includes uppercase letters.

Approach:

1. **Set Physical Naming Strategy:**

In your `application.properties` file, add the following property to set the physical naming strategy:

```bash
spring.jpa.hibernate.naming.physical-strategy=org.hibernate.boot.model.naming.PhysicalNamingStrategyStandardImpl
```

This ensures that Hibernate uses a standard physical naming strategy, preserving the exact table names specified in your entity classes.

2. **Annotate Entity Classes:**

In your entity classes, use the @Table annotation to specify the desired table name. Enclose the table name in double quotes ("), and if there are any uppercase letters, surround the entire name with backslashes (\). This tells Hibernate to treat the table name case-sensitively.

Example:

```java
@Entity
@Table(name = "\"Your_Table_Name\"")
public class YourEntity {
    // Entity properties and methods
}
```

Replace `"Your_Table_Name"` with your desired table name.

## Implementation:

1. Configure `application.properties`:

Open your application.properties file and add the property mentioned in step 1.

2. Annotate Entity Classes:

In your entity classes, annotate them with @Table as shown in step 2.

## Conclusion:

By following this approach, you can ensure that the table names in your PostgreSQL database match exactly what you specify in your Spring JPA @Table annotations, even when dealing with uppercase letters. This not only improves consistency but also makes your code more readable and maintainable.

Now you're ready to confidently manage your table names in PostgreSQL with Spring JPA!
