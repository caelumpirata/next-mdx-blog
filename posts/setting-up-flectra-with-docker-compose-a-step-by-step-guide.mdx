Flectra is a powerful open-source ERP and CRM platform. In this guide, we'll walk through the process of setting up Flectra using Docker Compose, which simplifies the deployment and management of Flectra and its required PostgreSQL database.

## Prerequisites

Before we begin, make sure you have the following installed on your system:

- Docker
- Docker Compose

## Step 1: Prepare the Configuration Files

We'll need two main configuration files: `docker-compose.yml` and `flectra.conf`. Let's create them one by one.

### docker-compose.yml

Create a file named `docker-compose.yml` in your project directory with the following content:

```yaml
version: "3"
services:
  db:
    image: postgres:15
    environment:
      - POSTGRES_USER=flectra
      - POSTGRES_PASSWORD=flectra
      - POSTGRES_DB=postgres
    volumes:
      - postgres-data:/var/lib/postgresql/data
    networks:
      - flectra-network
    ports:
      - "5432:5432"

  flectra:
    image: flectrahq/flectra:3.0
    depends_on:
      - db
    ports:
      - "7073:7073"
    environment:
      - HOST=db
      - USER=flectra
      - PASSWORD=flectra
    volumes:
      - flectra-data:/var/lib/flectra
      - ./flectra-server/addons:/mnt/extra-addons
      - ./flectra.conf:/etc/flectra/flectra.conf:ro
    user: "${UID}:${GID}"
    networks:
      - flectra-network

volumes:
  postgres-data:
  flectra-data:

networks:
  flectra-network:
    driver: bridge
```

### flectra.conf

Next, create a file named `flectra.conf` in the same directory with the following content:

```ini
[options]
addons_path = /opt/flectra/server/flectra/addons,/opt/flectra/server/addons,/mnt/extra-addons
data_dir = /var/lib/flectra
db_host = db
db_port = 5432
db_user = flectra
db_password = flectra
log_level = info
admin_passwd = admin
```

## Step 2: Set Up Environment Variables

Before running Docker Compose, we need to set the `UID` and `GID` environment variables. Open a terminal and run:

```bash
export UID=$(id -u)
export GID=$(id -g)
```

## Step 3: Create Required Directories and Volumes

Create a directory for custom addons:

```bash
mkdir -p flectra-server/addons
```

Create the necessary Docker volumes:

```bash
docker volume create postgres-data
docker volume create flectra-data
docker volume create flectra-addons
docker volume create flectra-filestore
```

## Step 4: Start the Containers

Now that everything is set up, we can start our Flectra and PostgreSQL containers:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

This command will download the necessary images (if they're not already present), create the containers, and start them in detached mode.

## Step 5: Verify the Setup

To check if the containers are running correctly, use:

```bash
docker-compose ps
```

You should see two containers (flectra and db) in the "Up" state.

To view the logs of the Flectra container:

```bash
docker-compose logs flectra
```

## Accessing Flectra

If everything has started correctly, you should now be able to access Flectra by opening a web browser and navigating to:

`http://localhost:7073`

You'll be greeted with the Flectra setup page where you can create your first database and start using Flectra.

## Conclusion

You've successfully set up Flectra using Docker Compose! This setup provides a isolated environment for Flectra and its database, making it easy to manage and deploy. Remember to back up your data regularly and keep your containers updated for the best performance and security.

Happy Flectra-ing!
