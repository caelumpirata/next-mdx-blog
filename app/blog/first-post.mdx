# My First Blog Post

This is the content of my first blog post. You can write your post here using Markdown and even use JSX!

## A Subheading

- List item 1
- List item 2
- List item 3

```JSX
const message = "Hello, world!";
console.log(message);
```

You can add more MDX features and components as needed.
